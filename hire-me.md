        Looking for a developer?

        I'm a skilled frontend game developer. I specialize in software architecture and tools development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was the lead programmer of Sweet Meat, which was featured by Google and nominated for Best Latin American Game in the <a href="bigfestival.com.br">BIG Festival</a>. I've developed games for important international names, such as Mattel and Coca-Cola, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a game or prototype you're interested in developing, I'd love to work with you on it. I work primarily with Unity targeting desktop and mobile but picking up new languages or engines isn’t a problem (in fact, I love it!).
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m available for hire on a freelance or contract basis. Why not send me an email to <a href="mailto:hey@lisandroct.com">hey@lisandroct.com</a> to discuss it further?
