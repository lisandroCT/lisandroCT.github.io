        I'm a skilled frontend game developer. I specialize in software architecture and tool development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was the lead programmer of Sweet Meat, a game featured by Google and nominated for Best Latin American Game in the <a href="http://bigfestival.com.br">BIG Festival</a>. I've developed games for important international brands, such as Mattel and Coca-Cola, among others.

    <p>
        If you have a game or prototype you're interested in developing, I'd love to work with you on it. I work primarily with Unity--targeting desktop and mobile--but picking up new languages or engines isn’t a problem (in fact, I love it!).
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m available for hire on a freelance or contract basis. Why not send an email to <a href="mailto:hey@lisandroct.com">hey@lisandroct.com</a> so we can discuss it further?
