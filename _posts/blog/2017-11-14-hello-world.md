Hi! I'm Lisandro Crespo, a game programmer from Rosario, Argentina. I'm really passionate about rendering and graphics technologies, computer sciences, software architecture and clean code.

Welcome to my blog!

<!--more-->

This will be my playground to document and share my last experiments, what I learn, my thoughts and projects, snippets of code (and Gists?) and some helpful time-saving tips.

I can sense the vast majority of the content will be around Unity, C#, Kotlin, game development, programming paradigms, graphics libraries, software architecture and clean code, but I love learning and exploring new horizons... So stay tuned!
