Educational video game for elementary school students in Uruguay. The app is pre-installed in the students' tablets and each child creates a profile linked to their class.
There are three games with social and physical health tips. The kids earn points by playing, updating their height and weight, and answering questions from the three virtual friends in the in-game chat.
Parents, doctors and teachers are able to track the kids' activities and progress.
